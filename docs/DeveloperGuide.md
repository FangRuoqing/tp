## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete Alex Yeoh`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete Alex Yeoh")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete Alex Yeoh` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Company feature
The company attribute is kept as a String and each Person has a company attribute, which is initialised as an empty String
and only added on later to the contact with the `co NAME c/COMPANY_NAME` command.

The adding of a company attribute to a contact follows the following activity diagram.

<puml src="diagrams/CompanyCommandActivityDiagram.puml" alt="CompanyCommandActivityDiagram"/>

The company attribute is displayed in the contact card. We initialise it as visible=False in the PersonListCard.fxml file,
and then set it as visible when the company attribute is not an empty String in the PersonCard.java file in the UI component.
This way there won't be awkward empty spaces in the contact card when the contact does not have a company attribute.

#### Design considerations:
The company attribute can only be added and removed with the company command format `co NAME c/COMPANY_NAME`, where COMPANY_NAME
is specified as empty for a remove company command. This is for user convenience as the current add command has several 
prefixes which might make an add command too length. Hence, we believe that with the company attribute being handled differently,
it would increase user convenience and usability.

### Find by Company feature
The find by company feature works in a similar way to AB-3's find by contact name feature. We were inspired by the implementation
of AB-3's find feature and modified it to cater to the company attribute. We actually modified our find feature to find
by partial words rather than full words, as it would increase user convenience. However, for the find by company feature, 
it works by matching full words rather than partial words.

We created a CompanyContainsKeywordsPredicate that checks whether the contacts in Connectify have company attributes that match
the keywords inputted. We create the CompanyContainsKeywordsPredicate object with the company keywords inputted in the
FindCompanyCommandParser. Then, in the FindCompanyCommand, we update the filtered list with the given CompanyContainsKeywordsPredicate
and check if the updated list is empty. If the updated list is empty. We will throw an error message to display to the user.

The feature flow follows the following sequence diagram.

<puml src="diagrams/FindCompanySequenceDiagram.puml" alt="FindCompanySequenceDiagram" />

#### Design considerations:
The find by company feature checks for contacts with the company attribute that matches the full keyword inputted, case-insensitive.
This is to ensure higher accuracy when searching for contacts from a particular company. 

By using the similar method used in the FindCommand and using a CompanyContainsKeywordsPredicate, we maintain consistency
of our implementation throughout the program.

### Meeting feature
The meeting attribute of an object is kept as a Meeting object with 4 attributes, a String description, a LocalDate date,
a LocalTime start and a LocalTime end. A Meeting object is initialized with 4 Strings, the meeting description, date, start and end
time. For our current implementation, each contact is only allowed to have one meeting object.

The adding of a meeting attribute to a contact follows the following sequence diagram.

<puml src="diagrams/AddMeetingCommandSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="AddMeetingCommandSequenceDiagram" />

**Challenges faced**
We initially meant to do the parsing of the date and time strings to the LocalDate and LocalTime respectively in the AddMeetingCommandParser.
However, we realised that if we wanted to initialize the meeting object with LocalDate and LocalTime, we would face several issues like
NullPointerException when we try to initialize 'null' meetings in a similar fashion to initializing empty company with "" to indicate
no company attribute. We considered using Optional class but were worried that it would overcomplicate the application architecture.
As a result, we decided to initialize a Meeting object with 4 Strings, the meeting description, date, start and end all stored
as Strings, and parse it into LocalDate and LocalTime in the initialization itself, handling empty strings accordingly.

### View meetings feature
The view meetings feature works in a simple way by filtering the contact list in Connectify by whether the meeting attribute of
the person is empty or not. The whole implementation is done in the ViewMeetingCommand.

The logic of the view meetings function follows the following activity diagram.

<puml src="diagrams/ViewMeetingsActivityDiagram.puml" width="574" />

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete Bernice Yu` command to delete the person with the name "Bernice Yu" in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete Bernice Yu` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_


### Star Feature
The implementation of the star feature allows users to star specific contacts in Connectify.

#### 1. Command Structure:
* The `StarCommand` class extends the abstract class `Command`.
* It defines a `COMMAND_WORD` which is used to invoke this specific command.
* The `MESSAGE_USAGE` constant provides information on how to use this command, including parameters and examples.

#### 2. Execution:
* When the execute method of `StarCommand` is called, it takes a `Model` object as a parameter, which represents the application's data model.
* It searches for the contact specified by the user within the list of contacts retrieved from the model.
* If the contact is not found, it throws a `CommandException`.
* If the contact is already starred, it throws a `CommandException`.
* If the contact is found and not already starred, it sets the `starred boolean` of the contact to `true` and updates the contact in the model.
* Finally, it returns a `CommandResult` indicating the success of the operation.

#### 3. Model Update:
* Upon successfully starring the contact, the `starredContact` object is created with the updated information, including the `starred boolean`.
* The model's `setPerson` method is called to update the contact with the new starred status.
* The filtered person list is then updated to reflect the changes in the model.

#### 4. Error Handling:

* The implementation handles various error scenarios, such as contact not found or already starred, by throwing `CommandException` with appropriate error messages.

#### Design Considerations:
* Data Consistency: The implementation ensures that the model is updated consistently after starring a contact to maintain data integrity.
* Scalability: Depending on the size of the contact list and frequency of use, the efficiency of searching for contacts might be a consideration for optimization.
* Flexibility: The design allows for easy extension with additional functionalities related to starring contacts, such as unstarring.

The diagram below shows the activity diagram for StarCommand.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**
Team size: 5

1. **Change priority command format to be more consistent with the other commands.** <br>
The current priority command format is
`pr/PRIORITY_LEVEL NAME`. We plan to change the format to `pr NAME pr/PRIORITY_LEVEL`, to match the formats of our other commands.
2. **Add priority level low** <br>
Currently, we only allow users to assign their contacts priority levels high and medium.
We plan to add and allow users to assign their contacts with the priority level low.
3. **Allow users to filter by low and no priority** <br>
Users are only allowed to filter by priority high and medium currently.
We plan to allow users to filter by no priority and also by low priority (see point 2). This is to provide users with more
convenient information for them to prioritise their networking efforts accordingly.
4. **Disallow users from adding meetings with timings where the end time is earlier than the start time** <br>
Currently, if users try to add a meeting with the timing where they specify the end time to be earlier than the start time, no error is raised.
We plan to introduce an error when users accidentally use the function this way. This is to prevent misuse of the function
as it would typically be illogical to have an end time earlier than the start.
5. **Enforce stricter constraints on email input for add and edit command** <br>
The current implementation of add and edit command only checks for the @domain. 
We plan to ensure that the email address input for the add and edit command follows 
the standard internet email address conventions strictly, which is to have a compulsory top-level domain (TLD). Hence, we
plan to introduce additional checks for email inputs without a top-level domain and raise an error. This is to prevent users
from accidentally adding an incorrect email.
6. **Allow users to perform commands on contacts that are not currently listed/displayed** <br>
Currently, after running some commands like `find` and `findco` where the displayed contact list is narrowed down, running other commands will only execute it on the
currently displayed list. As a result, for users to use the commands accurately and effectively, they currently need to run
the `list` command before running other commands to execute it on the entire contact list, which is inconvenient. Hence, we
plan to allow users to perform commands on contacts, based on names that are independent to the list that is filtered/displayed.
7. **Allow contact name inputs to include characters like '/'** <br>
Our current implementation of add and edit command does not
allow for special characters and only allows alphanumeric characters. We plan to allow the name input for add and edit command
to include special characters like '/' for inclusivity as some names have it.
8. **Allow duplicate contact names if they have different attributes** <br>
Currently, we do not allow duplicate contact names at all,
and names are case-insensitive (as in real life). However, we do note that while rare, some people may have the same exact name.
Hence, in consideration of this, we plan to allow duplicate contact names if they have different attributes
(e.g different company) in future versions.
9. **More consistent error messages throughout application** <br>
In our current implementation of the features, error messages
for incorrect command usage varies across different commands. Hence, we plan to modify error messages for incorrect command usage
to ensure cohesiveness and consistency throughout the application, to provide more clarity to users.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4.  The application should implement certain security measures to protect the users' private contact details from unauthorized access. This includes the encryption of sensitive data and preventing unauthorized access to the application's database.
5.  The application should be convenient enough for the users(including those that are disabled).
### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS
* **Private contact detail**: A contact detail that is not meant to be shared with others
* **Favorites**: The users can mark some users as favorites. This will increase the user’s efficiency when finding the people they like to contact
* **Tags**: The users can classify different contacts as from different groupings
