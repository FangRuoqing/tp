## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</box>


### Viewing help : `help`

Shows a message explaning how to access the help page.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `help`
    
### Adding a contact: `add`

Adds a contact in Connectify.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]…​`

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** In Connectify, contact names are case-insensitive and no duplicates are allowed. Hence `John Lim` is considered to be the
same person as `john lim`. As a result, you will see an error message if you try to add a contact with the same name as an existing contact,
even if it is in different case. Adding a contact with the same name as an existing contact, with extra spaces,
will produce a warning but does not prevent the user from doing so.
</box>
<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** A person's name can only contain alphanumeric characters. Special characters are not allowed. 
The maximum length of a person's name is 50 characters. <br>
</box>
<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** We allow duplicate phone number and email for contacts. This is to allow flexibility in using this feature
as some contacts may share the same general company email or phone number and not provide their personal information.
</box>
<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** A person's email and address are optional. 
Placeholders `[email]` and `[address]` will be displayed if none are provided. <br>
A person can have any number of tags (including 0). <br>
</box>

Examples:
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 a/John street, block 123, #01-01`
* `add n/Betsy Crowe t/recruiter e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Betsy street, block 456, #02-02 p/1234567`

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Listing all persons : `list`

Shows a list of all contacts in Connectify.

Format: `list`

### Editing a person : `edit`

Edits an existing contact shown in the displayed contact list.

Format: `edit NAME [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]…​`

    e.g `edit John Doe n/John` is the same as `edit john doe n/John`
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.<br>
For instance, if current tags for the contact is `CS2101`, and you want to add an additional tag, you have to specify `CS2101` again. <br>
Like this: `edit Betsy t/CS2101 t/friends`
* You can remove all the person’s tags by typing `t/` without
    specifying any tags after it.

Examples:
*  `edit John Doe p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the contact named 
    `John Doe` to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.

* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name is searched.
* Partial words will be matched e.g. `Han` will match `Hans`
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `find Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

Priorities help you manage your contacts in a more structured way,
especially in professional or organizational settings.

Format: `pr/PRIORITY_LEVEL NAME`

* The specified `NAME` of the contact to assign the priority level to is case-insensitive. <br>

* `pr/high Alex Tan` assigns `high` priority level to the contact name `Alex Tan` in Connectify.

### Filtering contacts by priority : `filter-PRIORITY_LEVEL`

Filters the contacts in Connectify by the specified priority level.

Format: `filter-PRIORITY_LEVEL`

* Acceptable values for `PRIORITY_LEVEL` are high and med.
* As the purpose of filtering by priority is so that users can easily identify 
and focus on only important contacts, filtering by priority level `none` is not an option.

Examples:
* `filter-high` returns a list of contacts with high priority.
* `filter-med` returns a list of contacts with medium priority.

the meeting details will be updated to the new one and a message will inform you the previous and updated meeting details.<br>
</box>
<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** For now, users are allowed to set meeting dates that has passed. This is to provide users with flexibility in using
this feature. If you wish to use the meetings function to remember meetings that you had with a contact, you are able to
do so as well.<br>

will throw an error.
* Entering `mtg NAME m/` or `mtg NAME` removes the meeting from the specified contact. <br>
If the person's contact did not have a meeting and `mtg NAME m/` is entered, 
an error message will appear and the person's contact will remain the same. 
* If `MEETING_DESCRIPTION` is entered, entering `MEETING_TIME` is mandatory.

Examples:
* `mtg Alex Tan m/interview time/05-11-2024 0800-0930`

If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, Connectify will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
